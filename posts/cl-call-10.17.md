1/ Exciting updates from ACD call today!

1. EIP-7742 included in the Pectra devnet-5! This unblocks blob target / max increase effort
2. engine_getBlobsV1 along with IDONTWANT p2p optimization has produced very promising results such much quicker block import time and reduction in network bandwidth usage!

We're very close to deliver a blob target / max number increase that
1. continues to provide more DA capacity to scale the Ethereum ecosystem and
2. does not harm solo stakers with all the network optimizations included!

2/ Next stop:
1. The community agreed on quickly release engine_getBlobsV1 and IDONTWANT optimizations to mainnet
2. Work with EL clients to prioritize and implement EIP-7742 (uncouple blob count from EL)
3. Continue to monitor the effects on mainnet nodes when more nodes join with latest optimizations and gather data points to support the increase
4. Adjust blob target / max number in the Pectra devnet-5 to test the blob increase
